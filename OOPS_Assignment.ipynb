Think of driving a car – you interact with the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift without needing to know the intricate details of how the engine works.\n",

The correct method to call is determined at compile time based on the arguments provided. Python does not directly support traditional method overloading like some other languages, but you can achieve similar results using default arguments, variable-length arguments, or type checking within a single method.\n",

        "Using Conventions (Single Underscore _): Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like public, private, or protected as in some other languages. Instead, a convention is used: prefixing an attribute or method name with a single underscore (_) indicates that it is intended for internal use within the class or module. While you can still access these members from outside the class, the single underscore signals to other developers that they should treat it as a private member and avoid direct access.\n",
        "Name Mangling (Double Underscore __): Prefixing an attribute or method name with a double underscore (__) triggers a mechanism called \"name mangling.\" Python internally changes the name of the attribute or method to include the class name (e.g., __my_attribute becomes _ClassName__my_attribute). This makes it harder (though not impossible) to access the attribute or method directly from outside the class, providing a stronger form of encapsulation.\n",
        "Property Decorators (@property): Property decorators are a more Pythonic way to control access to attributes. They allow you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, giving you fine-grained control over how the attribute is accessed and modified.

Instead of writing specific code for each type, you can write code that interacts with a base class or interface, and the appropriate method implementation for the specific object type will be called at runtime. This makes your code more flexible and reusable.\n",

You don't need to use conditional statements (like if-elif-else) to check the type of an object before calling a method. You can just call the method, and polymorphism takes care of executing the correct version.\n",

        "\n",
        "  Ans-In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special dunder methods that are used to define the string representation of an object. While they both provide a string representation, they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different contexts:\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__(self):\n",
        "Purpose: Defines the \"informal\" or \"user-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",
        "Goal: To be readable and understandable to a human user. It should aim to provide a concise and informative description of the object's state.\n",
        "Used by: The built-in str() function and the print() function.\n",
        "Fallback: If a class does not define __str__, Python will fall back to using __repr__.\n",
        "__repr__(self):\n",
        "Purpose: Defines the \"official\" or \"developer-friendly\" string representation of an object.\n",
        "Goal: To be unambiguous and ideally, the string returned by __repr__ should be a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object. It should provide enough information to precisely identify the object.\n",
        "Used by: The built-in repr() function, interactive Python sessions (when you simply type the object's name and press Enter), and debuggers.\n",
        "Fallback: If a class does not define __repr__, the default representation is used (which is usually not very informative).\n",
        "Key Differences Summarized:\n",
        "\n",
        "Audience: __str__ is for end-users, __repr__ is for developers.\n",
        "Goal: __str__ is for readability, __repr__ is for unambiguous representation.\n",
        "Output: __str__ can return any string, __repr__ should ideally return a string that could recreate the object.\n",
        "Fallback: str() falls back to __repr__ if __str__ is not defined; repr() does not fall back.\n",
        "When to use which:\n",
        "\n",
        "Always define __repr__ for your custom objects. This is crucial for debugging and introspection.\n",
        "Define __str__ if you want a more user-friendly output when the object is printed or converted to a string using str(). If you don't define __str__, the print() function will use the output of __repr__ by default."

        "  Ans-The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, in Python is a special method that is called when an object is about to be garbage collected. Garbage collection is the process by which Python automatically reclaims memory that is no longer being used by objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the significance of the __del__ method:\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleanup Operations: The primary purpose of __del__ is to perform cleanup operations before an object is destroyed and its memory is reclaimed. This can include tasks like:\n",
        "Closing file handles or network connections.\n",
        "Releasing system resources (e.g., locks, memory allocated outside of Python).\n",
        "Saving the object's state to a file or database.\n",
        "Resource Management: While Python's automatic garbage collection handles memory management, __del__ allows you to explicitly manage other resources that your object might be holding.\n",
        "Important Considerations and Caveats:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unpredictable Timing: The exact timing of when __del__ is called is not guaranteed. Python's garbage collector runs when it determines that an object is no longer reachable. This can happen at various points during program execution, or even not at all if the program exits before garbage collection occurs for a particular object.\n",
        "Circular References: Circular references between objects can prevent the garbage collector from detecting that objects are no longer needed, and thus __del__ might not be called.\n",
        "Exceptions in __del__: Raising exceptions within __del__ can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially crash your program. It's generally best to avoid complex logic or operations that could fail within a destructor.\n",
        "Alternatives: In many cases, it's better to use context managers (with statement) or explicit cleanup methods for resource management, as they provide more predictable and reliable ways to ensure resources are released when they are no longer needed. Context managers are particularly useful for resources that need to be acquired and released in a specific order."
